5,Banana Tree,The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy and are often mistaken for trees but what appears to be a trunk is actually a "false stem". The banana fruits develop from the banana heart in a large hanging cluster made up of tiers (called "hands") with up to 20 fruit to a tier. 
6,Spruce Tree,Spruces are large trees; from about 20 to 60 m tall when mature and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The leaves of spruces are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion each needle on a small peg-like structure. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old; leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs. Spruces are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (Butterfly) species.
7,Alder Tree,Alders are deciduous and the leaves are alternate; simple and serrated. They are mainly wind-pollinated but also visited by bees to a small extent.
8,Rubber Tree,Rubber Tree is a tall deciduous tree growing to a height of up to 43 m in the wild but cultivated trees are usually much smaller because drawing off the latex restricts the growth of the tree. The trunk is cylindrical and may have a swollen; bottle-shaped base.
9,Mahogany Tree,Typically the mahogany tree can grow up to 45m high; and 4m in diameter. But the average diameter is only about 1.5m feet. Often the first limb is over 15m up.
10,Ebony Tree,Ebony is dense enough to sink in water. It is finely-textured and has a very smooth finish when polished; making it valuable as an ornamental wood. Modern uses are largely restricted to small items and musical instrument parts.
11,Cedar Tree,Cedar trees can grow up to 30–40 m (occasionally 60 m) tall with spicy-resinous scented wood; thick ridged or square-cracked bark and broad; level branches. The leaves are evergreen; needle-like and 8–60 mm long.
12,Pine Tree,Pine trees are evergreen and can grow up to 80 m tall with the majority of species reaching 15–45m tall. Pines are long-lived and typically reach ages of 100–1.000 years; some even more.
13,Oak Tree,Oaks have spirally arranged leaves. In spring; a single oak tree produces both male flowers and small female flowers. The fruit is a nut called an acorn. Each acorn contains 1-3 seeds and takes 6–18 months to mature.
14,Spruce Tree,Spruces are large trees; from about 20–60 m tall when mature and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The leaves of spruces are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion each needle on a small peg-like structure. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old; leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs. Spruces are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (Butterfly) species.
15,Fir Tree,They are large trees; reaching heights of 10–80m tall with trunk diameters of 0.5–4m when mature. Firs can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by the unique attachment of their needle-like leaves and by their different cones.
16,Cedar Tree,Cedrus trees can grow up to 30–40 m (occasionally 60 m) tall with spicy-resinous scented wood; thick ridged or square-cracked bark and broad; level branches. The leaves are evergreen; needle-like and 8–60 mm long.
17,Pine Tree,Pine trees are evergreen and can grow up to 80 m tall with the majority of species reaching 15–45m tall. Pines are long-lived and typically reach ages of 100–1.000 years; some even more.
18,Spruce Tree,Spruces are large trees; from about 20–60 m tall when mature and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The leaves of spruces are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion each needle on a small peg-like structure. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old; leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs. Spruces are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (Butterfly) species.
19,Fir Tree,They are large trees; reaching heights of 10–80m tall with trunk diameters of 0.5–4m when mature. Firs can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by the unique attachment of their needle-like leaves and by their different cones.
20,Willow Tree,Willows are low-growing or creeping shrubs which rarely exceeds 6 cm in height; though it spreads widely across the ground. The leaves are typically elongated but may also be round to oval; frequently with serrated edges.
21,Cactus,They live in extremely dry environments. Cactus have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants; others are grown for forage; and others for food (particularly their fruit). Great majority of them has no leaves. Photosynthesis takes place in the stems
22,Baobab Tree,Baobabs reach heights of 5 to 30m and have trunk diameters of 7 to 11m. There are known specimens that is older than 1000 years. The fruit has a velvety shell and is about the size of a coconut; weighing about 1.5 kilograms. It has an acidic tart flavor.
23,Date Tree,Date Tree is a flowering plant species in the palm family. Cultivated for its edible sweet fruit. Date trees typically reach about 21–23 metres in height; growing singly or forming a clump with several stems from a single root system. Date fruits (dates) are oval-cylindrical; 3–7 cm long and about 2.5 cm in diameter; ranging from bright red to bright yellow in color; depending on variety. They are very sweet; containing about 75 percent of sugar when dried.
24,Desert Sage,Desert Sage is a woody subshrub reaching up to 1m in height and width. The grey-green leaves are narrow and lanceolate are tapered at the base and rounded at the tip and have a smooth and round margin. They are generally basal; and about 1–3 cm long. They have an intense but pleasant; mildly intoxicating minty aroma; with the scent released when the foliage is handled or crushed.
25,Aloe Tree,In its native climes this slow-growing tree can reach up to 18m high and 0.9m in stem diameter. The tree aloe is often used as an ornamental plant.
26,Oak Tree,Oaks have spirally arranged leaves. In spring; a single oak tree produces both male flowers and small female flowers. The fruit is a nut called an acorn. Each acorn contains 1-3 seeds and takes 6–18 months to mature.
27,Baobab Tree,Baobabs reach heights of 5 to 30m and have trunk diameters of 7 to 11m. There are known specimens that is older than 1000 years. The fruit has a velvety shell and is about the size of a coconut; weighing about 1.5 kilograms. It has an acidic tart flavor.
28,Acacia Tree,Acacia is a common food source and host plant for butterflies. They can be found both thorned and thornless. Its flowers are yellow and aromatic.

Milky latex of the tree is extremely poisonous and can cause blindness; severe skin irritation and poisoning (when ingested) with humans and animals. However when properly used this plant can serve as purgative or drug curing ulcers.
30,Eucalyptus Tree,A mature eucalyptus may take the form of a low shrub or a very large tree. Nearly all eucalyptus are evergreen.
